# The single most important factor while designing: Consistency
# Consistency: The single most important factor while designing

On this post I would like to explain what I consider to be, the single most important factor while designing. But before I start, let me be clear about this: You are not getting advice from a professional. I am not a designer! I really enjoy designing both in 2D (mainly Inkscape and Illustrator among others) and 3D (Rhino, Blender, etc) but I could easily say that I’m really far from being a “qualified” designer. You have been warned!

In my opinion, consistency is the single most important factor while designing. Every time I see a just-graduate Graphic Designer mixing two completely different themes for a website mockup I kinda feel bad. 

Precense or absence of consistency can be noticed as soon as the second element is added to your design. Let's see some examples:

### Example 1
[image with 3 icons, one with sharp edges, the other ones flat, rounded]

Is it constent? No, it is not. The first two elements belong the Foundation icon set, which rounds most of the edges. The third element come from the Entypo icon set which uses sharp edges. You better use only foundation icons with round edges or change the first two to their Entypo equivalent. 

### Example 2
[]


Don't do that and you end up with a really ugly design, that's it. Abundance of consistency or lack of it make the people say "this is a good design" or "this is a bad design".

I think that consistency 

<blockquote>Agreement or harmony of parts or features to one another or a whole:  correspondence;
specifically: ability to be asserted together without contradiction.
- Merriam webster</blockquote>

You can start to notice how consistent your design is when the third and fourth element is added. Take for example the following image

[image with 3 icons, one with sharp edges, the other ones flat, rounded]

Is it constent? No, it is not. The first two elements belong the Foundation icon set, which rounds most of the edges. The third element come from the Entypo icon set which uses sharp edges. You better use only foundation icons with round edges or change the first two to their Entypo equivalent. Don't do that and you end up with a really ugly design, that's it. Abundance of consistency or lack of it make the people say "this is a good design" or "this is a bad design".

I believe that 
In my humble opinion, every single design can be rated as "good" or "bad" just by
 
•	Still, I feel confident enough with my skills to sustain the theory that consistency is –or should be- the single most important factor while making a new drawing, logo, infographic or drawing.
•	Every time I see a recent Graphic Designer graduate mixing two completely different themes for a website mockup I feel baffled. It is not necessarily their fault I must say, I’ve seen lack of consistency even on the works of professional creative agencies around here.

•	If your design is feeling flat, you should stick to flat patterns.
•	If your design is feeling duo-toned, you should try to use those two tones as much as possible.
•	If your design is feeling clip-arty, you should use only clip-arty elements. Someone may that doing a design using clip-art is an aberration in design. I strongly disagree. Lack of consistency is an aberration. Clip arts are famous for being abused on formal documents, that’s why we associate clip art with a “bad design”.

•	Every time I see a just-graduate Graphic Designer mixing two completely different themes for a website mockup I kinda feel bad. Believe me, it is not them, it is their teachers.
•	It amazes me to meet just-graduate Graphic Designers making inconsistent 
•	It amazes me to see that many just-graduate designers give very little importance to this key aspect.

•	Consistency is, by far, one of the most important factors while designing.

•	Before I start let me warn you about one thing: I am not a designer! 
•	Before I try to explain this design factor let me warn you that I’m not a designer, I’m an engineer (I got a B.S. in Electronics), still I’ve always been very interested in design
•	Now, let warn you that I am not a designer
•	I’m not a designer (I got a B.S. in Electronics)
•	I’ve seen so many designs
