# Give that woman a lingot

today I woke up, entered Duolingo to complete my daily French routine, and saw an usual increase in lingots [I had about 800, looking for 1000 or more, suddenly I got/saw more than 1000 lingots on my account]. What the...? I thought.
I got more than 130 lingots by posting a Vladimir Putin meme in response to a comment that literally made my day.

many thanks to all the lingot donors!
