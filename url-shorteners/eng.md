Time ago, Hootsuite called URL shorteners the [The Unsung Heroes Of Social Media Marketing](https://goo.gl/W9IQKX) for a good reason.

Using an URL shortener not only makes your links look pretty. They are also a great tool to get analytics
Despite of how easy it is to shorten your URL's most of the people don't do it, probably because they don't know how or maybe because they don't understand its usefulness.
