# The art of working on real-time collaborative environments

After a deep restrospective analysis I found that working on real-time collaborative environments requieres people to have a different mindset. Most of the people is simply not prepared to work this way and they *freak out* when seeing someone else editing near them. Real-time collaborative tools are essentially a new synergy paradigm.

<hidden>Real-time collaboration is a completely different working paradigm, a new synergy paradigm.[, probably the actual meaning of synergy.]</hidden>

<hidden>people are still using the old-fashioned tools some people have happyly adopted these new technologies. Almost 3 years ago I decided to completely </hidden>

<hidden>New real-time collaborative tools such as Google Docs have been trending in recent years. Some people have happily adopted this new synergy paradigm, while others are still using the old-fashioned tools they are used to.</hidden>

<hidden>I was once forced to go back to the old Microsoft Word while working with a client that hated Google -and all of its products- and quicly realized two things:</hidden>

<hidden>I wrote *less* information, probably because inside me, I was thinking that what I was writing wasn't going to "derive into action". Non collaborative tools tend to create "informational" documents, "read-only" docuements, "non actionable" information. I felt myself doing a high-school essay where I didn't know if the teacher was really going to read what I wrote. Real-time docuemnts force you to write useful information.</hidden>


<hidden>A quite curious fact about RTC is that it forces you to use your right-side of your brain. You can no longer erase a paragraph just because you don't like it. Is that information useful for someone else? Why did the other person write that information? If I decide to move a paragraph, how will I ensure that the others will find the new location of the paragraph? Even the position where the cursor is has an effect on other people! If you are a [detailed observer, obsessive] you will know that people will try to avoid editing exactly where your cursor is, maybe because "you own that paragraph".</hidden>


<hidden>RTC fustrates many people who don't understand this new paradigm causing them to do what I consider a *the worst thing you can do in RTC*: The voice of frustration that says "Look I will clone this document... Now you edit yours and I edit mine and at the end we just merge contents, ok?". This is the single worst thing you can do on RTC because it shows that:</hidden>

<hidden>1.- You don't know how to work collaboratively</hidden>
<hidden>2.- You literally [erase, destroy] the actual [gem, purpose, meaning] of RTC! Which is the fact having to merge information. This is [a sin, something really really bad]. The point of RTC is that you have to solve this merging issues (or GIT merge conflicts a developer would call) *at the moment*, not on a later stage, but at that moment, by engaging into a healthy discussion with your conterpart. Not doing so simply [leaves for the last, postpones] this discussion for a later stage [(if it occurs)] that your counterpart may not even be willing to spend time in. Leading to a document that will end-up with his version (I accept-theirs), or my version (I accept-mine). All this if, and only if, they decide to merge the actual contents. It is very commong for versions to branch out into version that will be simply lost.</hidden>

<hidden>Learning how to properly and effectively work on RTC is a must, these kind tools are the future.</hidden>

<hidden>After several years using real-time tools I realized that </hidden>
<hidden>When information is shared instantly, there is no need to [write unuseful information]</hidden>
