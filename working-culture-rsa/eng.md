# How to create the right working culture at your organization

Creating the right working culture is essential for any organization. If you are a CEO, CTO or a CIO, this video by the RSA is a must see to understand why your organization needs give their employees more freedom to choose how they want to work.

There are a lot of organizations with similar values and similar missions. All of them hire more or less the same kind of people, similar skills and similar mindsets. They all create products that are *-in most of the cases-* similar to other existing products. These organizations work more or less with the same tools than others. <hidden>Also their ultimate purpose is, surprisingly the same: They all "want to be different".</hidden> Interestingly, their ultimate purpose is also the same: **They all want be different.**

<hidden>It is alarming to know that 71% of the US workers is not happy at work. Technology is part of the problem.</hidden>

<hidden>Social networks are shaping how we work. When we think about it, using a social network is a completely different kind of mindset</hidden>

<hidden>For me, the top 3 steps to create the right working culture at your organization:
Here are my own 3 steps to change the working culture at your organization: </hidden>

In my opinion, the first 3 steps to change your working culture at your tech industry (these might not work in all types of industries) are the following ones:

 1.- **Be flexible:** Allow people to choose how they want to work, be careful though, giving employees too much flexibility may harm your organization in the long term. The difficult part is to **calibrate the compass**, finding the right balance is process that could take a few months at best.
 
 2.- **Be innovative:** Don't be afraid to change the rules of the game, there is nothing of merit in implementing exactly the same kind of tools and processes than other organizations. Would you dare to gradually ban or limit mailing in your organization and replace it with a more efficient communication tool like Telegram, HipChat or even a social network group? Mails are quickly becoming old, people is now more interested in checking their Facebook messages than checking their mailboxes.
 
 <hidden>Here are some uncommon things modern organizations do: treehouse: flatlearership, google: sliders, facebook: mail ban?, facebook: open offices (photo mark's desk), others: dog friendly spaces</hidden>
 
 3.- **Repeat, repeat and repeat the new culture you want to create:** Making a change in the organization' culture is essentially changing how people think. <hidden>The problem is that people are not good at changing how they think. Everyone is biased to believe that only they are right.</hidden> The problem is that by our human nature, **we tend to believe that we are always right**. Most of the people is afraid to explore new ways to do things, and they have, indeed, some right to think this way: Doing things in a different way is hard. <hidden>Shaping the culture at work will always be a push and pull game.</hidden> Creating a different culture at work will always requiere a external force that drives the change. <hidden>Hence the need to force the new mindset you want to create.</hidden>
