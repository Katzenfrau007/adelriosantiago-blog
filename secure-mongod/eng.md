# How to secure your MongoDB installation

MongoDB is often associated with poor security database deploys, I think the main reason for this is very simple: By default MongoDB requieres no password to authenticate. This simple fact makes it one of the most [probable to misuse] database frameworks out there. Programers, under the pressure to deplot the project usually give little or no importance to securing their DB's. Also MongoDB University makes (IMHO) a big mistake not including this specific subject on their courses. I think it is until the third tutorial when this subjectÂº is addressed



This article/study [] conducted a ethical hack and found that [5000 databases without password] some of them including sensite information.

There is no excuse! Secure your MongoDB deploy now!
