# Why you should have a password notebook
# Why you should have a password notebook

--- draft

Recording your passwords is not only professional, it is a must in case you die.
If you would die today, would your colleagues be able to continue your work? Would the entire startup/company go down?
Let's face it: Nobody can remember so many passwords, you need to record them in some way.
I don't recommend password reminder applications such as LastPass. How come we suddenly trust all our passwords to an unknown company? What if they are hacked? (LastPass security was compromised a few years ago)[link].
