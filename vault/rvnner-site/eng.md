Today I went into GoDaddy and searched domain names for hours -literally-. A good, short domain name is difficult to find these days. Most of them are already taken and then you have to creatively fix the domain name changing some letters or the order of the words {while keeping the name understandable] [without changing too much the name to the point it becomes obnoxiousº unintellegible]

I recommend people to try name hacks. In the recent years there have been an increasing number of domain name endings that allow you to come up with a good compound name.
Some of the best name hacks I have found are:

 - do.minik.us - He bought minik.us and created the subdomain do, [formingº his full name Dominik] A visual artist from []. 
 - ma.tt - Simply, one of the best name hacks I've seen, it is short and createsº his name/nicknameº Matt

Here are some tips when looking for a new domain name:

 - Play with the domain name endings: Pretty obviuos ehh? I found [this website] with a compliation all the available domain name endings out there. And [here is an impresive website] that allows you to search for words starting, having or ending on certain letters. I have tried Scrabble several websites (people use it mostly for Scrabble matches) and this is for sure the best one.
 - [try adding a posh ending, like [list], any word ending in list could make a good domain name]. IO domain name endings are also really good.
 - 
 - 
 - If you can't still found your domain name try a non meaningful word.
 create non meaningful words in this order:
 
 -- try removing a word, this is especially true in english where the pronunciation often makes words sound like if they didn't have a letter on it. [flickr is the best example]

 i have found that this is also a proof that a company is important but more important is the product you offer, domain names like www.dribbble.com and [www.flickr.com] could have costedº 3 dollars!
 
 
Today I went into GoDaddy and searched domain names for hours, I started fantasazing about h,I liked some of them and was about to buy them, although a few minutes later I would look at them again and say "Well this domain name is probably not that good...".


Still, today I decided to buy www.rvnner.com, of course that "runner" was already taken 

The name "runner" was already taken (it would surprise me a lot it wouldn't), but I decided to buy "rvnner", as you might know the letter "V" was, time ago, used as "U"
