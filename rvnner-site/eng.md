# RVNNER site

I went into GoDaddy and searched domain names for hours, I liked some of them and was about to buy them, although a few minutes later I would look at them again and say "Well this domain name is probably not that good...".

Still, today I decided to buy www.rvnner.com, of course that "runner" was already taken 

The name "runner" was already taken (it would surprise me a lot it wouldn't), but I decided to buy "rvnner", as you might know the letter "V" was, time ago, used as "U"
