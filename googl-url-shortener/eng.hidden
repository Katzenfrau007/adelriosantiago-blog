# Why you should use url shorteners

--- 

there is a good reason why using url shorteners is a good idea
i personally recommend using the Goo.gl url shortener (https://goo.gl/)
The Goo.gl url shortener can help you track clicks and gives you analytics like this [image]

just be careful to select an address that is not associated with spam, i think that the best url shortener is goo.gl
