# My top ten aberrations of the computing world

?	Windows auto language change when writing 
?	Resizing on mac (after being a Windows)
?	(Mac + Q)? quits the app! No way! I wanted to put a @
?	Back and Forward with Shift+scroll on most web browsers, OMG i just wanted to scroll horizontally! Even more you can’t go back and forward precisely that way!
?	Windows 7 autoplay when pluging in a USB stick... nobody uses it anyway...
?	Firefox is already running but it is not responding... Well why do you tell me so... Wouldn’t it be better if you automatically close it and launch it again?
?	Well this is embarrasing, screen... Well probably more embarrasing is when the next user know what i was browsing... Can we give it a different name?
?	Send file via Bluetooth. Trustme you won’t make it pair. Trustme you are not going to send that file via bluetooth. Trustme you better send an email to yourself
?	Skype quit, do you really want to quit?
