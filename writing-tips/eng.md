# Writing tips, tricks and tools

Whether if it is a technical article or a novel, here are some writing tips, tricks and tools that I often use


---


-Don't ever erase a single line! Truly you MUST NEVER erase a single line you write, there are no bad lines. Writing should be an iterative process not a single-time, activity that outputsº into a perfect article
-Use Focus Writer! There are several tools out there, some of them have their pro's and con's, I prefer FocusWriter because it is blazingly fast, also it makes a typewriter sound which creates a very nice atmosphere.
-Divide your writing into these 3 lapsesº:
--speed drafting: den't ever think on stop writing just becase you wrote "craetive" instead of "creative", you will fix those issues in a later lapseº

When writing send the sentences you like more to the top and send thos you don't like to the bottom, remember the first rule, don't ever erase a sentece if you want to create a diferente version of it, rewrite it and send it to the top and continue writing as fast as you can.
-Dopn't stop for grammar mistakes on your first draft. If you are not hitting [200 words] per minute you are doing it wrong. I consider this to be true especially when doing a draft, there is a
