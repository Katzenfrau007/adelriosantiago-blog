# Writing tips, tricks and tools

Whether if it is a technical article or a novel, here are some writing tips, tricks and tools that I often use


---

### How you should structure your writing lapsesº

### General tips when writing

### Tools you should make use of

-Don't ever erase a single line! Truly you MUST NEVER erase a single line you write, there are no bad lines. Writing should be an iterative process not a single-time, activity that outputsº into a perfect article. Write as is you were writing on an old typewriter machine, you just let mistakes happen and don't really care about them, your creativity [you creativity is very valuable, don't waste it stopping to fix grammar mistakes] if you don't have lot's of mistakes after your speed drafting you are making it wrong.
-Divide your writing into these 3 lapsesº:
--speed drafting: den't ever think on stop writing just becase you wrote "craetive" instead of "creative", you will fix those issues in a later lapseº
--sentence polising: polish all your senteces, every single one, rewrite them until you are happy with them
--grammar and syntax checking: this should be the very last step, you might want to accompanyº this lapseº with a synonim polishing where you could go to [this page] and carefully selecting the best synonim in accordanceº to the feelingº you want to express
--post writing: I consider this to be a very important step while writing, it is all about forgetting what you just wrote about for a few days and then later check it, you will realize that many sentences didn't actually make the meaning you wanted to giveº. You will realize that you look silly on other parts -although I must warn you that this shouldn't make you botherº that much-, -you shouldn't give that much importance to this or you will never have the guts to publish your article-, still if you feel that you need to change it, do so.

-When writing on a computer use shortcuts that will indicate what to do later. When you are writing your priority is to write as fast as you can, dont stop writing for long periods of time thinking on the best synonim for a word, if you do that then you will lose momentum and forget the rest of the sentence. There are some shortcuts that I use when writing, here are some of them:

--When 

--When I like the last sentence or word I wrote but it needs to be polished then I end that sentence with a º character, it doesn't has to be this character, I use it because it is

-Use the "boiling senteces technique", the boiling sentences technique is a term coined by me, or maybe it exists but I have never heard about it. When writing send the sentences you like more to the top and send thos you don't like to the bottom, remember the first rule, don't ever erase a sentece if you want to create a diferente version of it, rewrite it and send it to the top and continue writing as fast as you can.
-Dopn't stop for grammar mistakes on your first draft. If you are not hitting [200 words] per minute you are doing it wrong. I consider this to be true especially when doing a draft, there is a

-Use the rigth tools:
--Use Focus Writer! There are several tools out there, some of them have their pro's and con's, I prefer FocusWriter because it is blazingly fast, also it makes a typewriter sound which creates a very nice atmosphere.
